#Niamh Canning Physiotherapy

##An explaination
1.  As you can see my project is not nearly finished, while I can give you my reasons as to why I wasn't able to finish it in time, I doubt you need or
want to hear that through the many submissions you see.  What I do is apologise for not having the website up to a standard I would have liked to have 
produced to you.  Hopefully in the coming projects I am able to show the standard of my work.

2. I realise I hadn't committed often or at all, this is due to forgetting the rule to commit often.
